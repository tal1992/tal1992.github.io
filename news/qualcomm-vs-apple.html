<h4>Apple and Qualcomm are engaged in what will likely be a yearslong and epic battle. Following news that Qualcomm had been charging heightened royalties for use of its tech, as well as reports indicating Qualcomm required Apple to pay a percentage of the iPhone’s revenue in return for the use of Qualcomm patents, Apple has sued the company in three countries.</h4>

<h4>In the United States, Apple is suing Qualcomm for a hefty $1 billion — but it has also filed a lawsuit in China for $145 million, as well as in the United Kingdom. Now, Qualcomm is following with its own countersuit (but losing quite a bit of money).</h4>

<h4>Here’s everything you need to know about the lawsuit battle so far.</h4>

<h3>Qualcomm wants to ban iPhones in China</h3>

<h4>This ban has nothing to do with the Chinese government, but rather with Qualcomm’s claim that Apple has stolen patents. According to a Bloomberg report, the chipmaker has now filed paperwork to ban both the sale and the manufacturing of the popular smartphone in China.</h4>


<h4>It’s Qualcomm’s latest and most pointed barb at Apple yet. A company spokeswoman told Bloomberg, “Apple employs technologies invented by Qualcomm without paying for them,” noting that the iPhone’s power management and Force Touch features are just “a few examples of the many Qualcomm technologies that Apple uses to improve its devices and increase its profits.”</h4>

<h4>Apple has refuted these claims, with a spokesman noting, “In our many years of ongoing negotiations with Qualcomm, these patents have never been discussed. Like their other courtroom maneuvers, we believe this latest legal effort will fail.”</h4>

<h4>Indeed, it would be a surprise if a Chinese court acquiesced to Qualcomm’s request, as there is no historical precedent for such a move. But in this ugly legal battle, anything is possible.</h4>

<h3>Qualcomm asks U.S. trade regulators to ban iPhone imports<h3>

<h4>Qualcomm is seeking to ban certain iPhone models from sale in the U.S., according to a new lawsuit.</h4>

<h4>On July 7, the San Diego, California-based chip maker filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission and the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California requesting a Cease and Desist Order to to ban new iPhones from coming into the country. It also asked regulators to bar further sales of iPhones that have already been imported.</h4>

    <h4>Qualcomm alleges that Apple is violating six patents that have to do with extending its battery life. Crucially, unlike the other patents at dispute in the companies’ patent spat, it says that none are “essential to a standard,” and that Qualcomm isn’t required by law to license them.</h4>
